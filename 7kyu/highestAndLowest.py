# In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

# Examples
# high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5") # return "5 1"
# high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5") # return "5 -3"
# high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5") # return "9 -5"

def high_and_low(numbers):
    # ...
    int_arr = [int(n) for n in numbers.split(" ")]
    return f"{max(int_arr)} {min(int_arr)}"
